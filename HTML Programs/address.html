		<h1> <center> Doing Small things Can Make Success </center> </h1>
			<p>
				There are few people have the ability to do the great things and be admired by the world. In fact, many people become successful by doing the small things. As the old saying goes, 
			</p>
				<blockquote> 
					<p> "If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way."</p>
					<cite> &mdash; Napoleon Hill</cite> 
				</blockquote>  

			<p> It means that if we haven't got the opportunity to do the great things, we can gain success by doing the small things perfectly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Actually, history abounds examples to prove this saying. The late <abbr title="Chief executive officer
				">CEO</abbr> of Apple, Steve Jobs, is a case in point. He was so addicted to details that he could not stop pushing his staff to pursue perfection in design and production. It's due to his focus on small things that Apple made great success in the mobile field.
			</p>
			<p>				
				As college students, <q> we should improve ourselves by doing the small things perfectly.</q> Only when all small things are done well can we make a success.
